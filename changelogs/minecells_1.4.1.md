# Mine Cells 1.4.1

## Mobs

Improvements:

- Dashing mobs (Mutated Bat, Shieldbearer, Conjunctivius) have had their dashes tweaked
- The dashes should be less annoying, and also show their direction with particles
- Nerfed the damage and timing of some entities' attacks

## New Weapons:

- **Broadsword**  
  Slow, but hits hard
- **Frost Blast**  
  Freezes enemies in front of you
- **Phaser**  
  Teleports you behind an enemy, grants you **Assassin's Strength**

## New Status Effects:

- **Stunned**  
  The affected mob is unable to move or perform any goals
- **Frozen**  
  Works like the stunned effect, but is removed when the mob is hit. Turns into slowness when it ends
- **Assassin's Strength**  
  Makes your first attack stronger
