# Mine Cells 1.4.1

## Mobs

Improvements:

- Dashing mobs (Mutated Bat, Shieldbearer, Conjunctivius) have had their dashes tweaked
- The dashes should be less annoying, and also show their direction with particles
- Nerfed the damage and timing of some entities' attacks

## Weapons:

- **Broadsword**  
  Slow, but hits hard
- **Frost Blast**  
  Freezes enemies in front of you
- **Phaser**  
  Teleports you behind an enemy, grants you **Assassin's Strength**
- **Balanced Blade**   
  Deals more damage with each consecutive attack
- **Crowbar**  
  Destroys doors instantly. Deals critical damage for a few seconds after destroying a door
- **Nutcracker**  
  Deals critical damage to **Frozen** and **Stunned** enemies 

Most of these weapons can be found in chests. Phaser rarely drops from Promenade's Runners

- Updated Better Combat animations of some weapons

## New Status Effects:

- **Stunned**  
  The affected mob is unable to move or perform any goals.  
  Indicated by spinning stars above the mob's head.
- **Frozen**  
  Works like the stunned effect, but is removed when the mob is hit. Turns into slowness when it ends.  
  Indicated by particles and a blue tint.
- **Assassin's Strength**  
  Makes your first attack stronger

## Blocks and items:

- **Vine Rune**, **Runic Vine Plant**, **Runic Vine** and **Runic Vine Stone**
